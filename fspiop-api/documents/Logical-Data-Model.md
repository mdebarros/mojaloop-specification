## 4. API Supporting Data Model

This section defines the data model.

Section 4.1 introduces the formats used for the element data types used by the API.

Section 4.2 defines the element data types used by the API.

Section 4.2.16.2 defines the elements types used by the API.

Section 4.3.35 identifies the complex types used by the API.

Section 4.5 identifies the enumerations used by the API.
Logical Data Model

### 4.1 Length Specification
All element data types have both a minimum and maximum length. These lengths are indicated by one of the following:

- A minimum and maximum length
- An exact length
- A regular expression limiting the element such that only a specific length or lengths can be used.

#### 4.1.1 Minimum and Maximum Length

If a minimum and maximum length is used, this will be indicated after the data type in parentheses: First the minimum value (inclusive value), followed by two period characters (..), and then the maximum value (inclusive value).

Examples:

- String(1..32) – A String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long.

#### 4.1.2 Integer(3..10) – An UndefinedEnum

The API data type **UndefinedEnum** is a JSON String consisting of one to 32 uppercase characters including an underscore
character ( _) .

##### 4.1.2.1 Regular Expression

### 4.6 Error Codes

Each error code in the API is a four-digit number, such as **1234**, where the first number (**1** in the example) represents the highlevel error category, the second number (**2** in the example) represents the low-level error category, and the last two numbers (**34** in the example) represents the specific error. Figure 1 shows the structure of an error code. The following sub-sections contains information and defined error codes per high-level error category.

![Figure 1 - Error code structure](/assets/diagrams/images/figure62.svg)

**Figure 1 – Error code structure**

Each defined high- and low-level category combination contains a generic error (_x_**0**_xx_), which can be used if there is no specific error, or if the server would not like to return information which is considered private.

All specific errors below _xx_**40**, that is, _xx_**00** to _xx_**39**, are reserved for future use by the API. All specific errors above and including _xx40_, can be used for scheme-specific errors. If a client receives an unknown scheme-specific error, the unknown scheme-specific error should be interpreted as a generic error for the high- and low-level category combination instead (_xx_**00**).

#### 4.6.1 Communication Errors – 1xxx

All possible communication or network errors that could arise that cannot be represented by an HTTP status code should use
the high-level error code 1 (error codes **1**_xxx_). Because all services in the API are asynchronous, these error codes should generally be used by a Switch in the Callback to the client FSP if the Peer FSP could not be reached, or if a callback is not received from the Peer FSP within an agreed timeout.

Low level categories defined under Communication Errors:

- **Generic Communication Error – 10**_xx_

See Table 105 for all communication errors defined in the API.

| Error Code | Name | Description | /participants | /parties | /transactionRequests | /quotes | /authorizations | /transfers | /transactions | /bulkQuotes | /bulkTransfers |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1000** | Communication error | Generic communication error. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **1001** | Destination communication error | The Destination of the request failed to be reached. This usually indicates that a Peer FSP failed to respond from an intermediate entity. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |

**Table 105 – Communication errors – 1xxx**

#### 4.6.2 Server Errors – 2xxx

All errors occurring in the server in which the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request from the client should use the high-level error code 2 (error codes **2**_xxx_). These error codes should indicate that the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the requested service.

Low-level categories defined under server Errors:

- **Generic server Error – 20**_xx_

See Table 106 for all server errors defined in the API.

| Error Code | Name | Description | /participants | /parties | /transactionRequests | /quotes | /authorizations | /transfers | /transactions | /bulkQuotes | /bulkTransfers |

| **2000** | Generic server error | Generic server error to be used for not disclosing information that may be considered private. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **2001** | Internal server error | A generic unexpected exception. This usually indicates a bug or unhandled error case. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **2002** | Not implemented | Service requested is not supported by the server. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **2003** | Service currently unavailable | Service requested is currently unavailable on the server. This could be because maintenance is taking place, or because of a temporary failure. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **2004** | Server timed out | A time out has occurred, meaning the next Party in the chain did not send a callback in time. This could be because a timeout is set too low or because something took longer than it should. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| **2005** | Server busy | Server is rejecting requests due to overloading. Try again later. | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |

**Table 106 – Server errors – 2xxx**

**Client Errors – 3xxx**

All possible errors occurring in the server where the server’s opinion is that the client have sent one or more erroneous parameters should use the high-level error code 3 (error codes **3**_xxx_). These error codes should indicate that the server could not perform the service according to the request from the client. The server should provide an explanation why the service could not be performed.

Low level categories defined under client Errors:
- **Generic Client Error – 30**_xx_
  - See Table 107 for the generic client errors defined in the API.
- **Validation Error – 31**_xx_
  - See Table 108 for the validation errors defined in the API.
- **Identifier Error – 32**_xx_
  - See Table 109 for the identifier errors defined in the API.
- **Expired Error – 33**_xx_
  - See Table 110 for the expired errors defined in the API.
